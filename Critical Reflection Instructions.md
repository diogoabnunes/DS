# Assignment :: Individual Critical Reflection - How to do it? When and where to submit?

In order to close the course, we want each student to write a small individual critical reflection about their learning process during MEIC-DSLE-2021-22. 

In concrete, it is expected that students analyze, reflect, write, and share with the teachers, the essential of what they learned during DSLE that is considered to have an impact on the academic path, professional life, be it positively or not.

There are several ways to elaborate a critical reflection.

A simple way is using the “What? So what? Now What?”

- What was my goal? What did I do? What was I feeling? What went well? What went poorly?
- So what was important? So what knowledge can inform me? So what did I learn about myself
- Now what can I do to improve my knowledge? Now what can I do to improve my skills? Now what can I do differently?

Another way is to simply start by using some typical expressions, such as:

- I was surprised that…
- I was pleased to know that…
- I was disappointed that…
- I was already aware of… but…
- I had more difficulty in…
- I felt I had an easier time in…

The reflection should be concise but rich in content, showing a personal perspective over the course (do not repeat the contents of the course, but emphasize some) ad delivering depth of analysis (do not be superficial, ask yourself why and why), all in a very open and sincere way.  

The overall length of the reflection should fit in max. 2 x A4 pages with default margins, i.e. 800-1000 words, using Times New Roman 12pt. You can write in English or in Portuguese, whichever of the two you prefer.

In addition to the above, there are many resources explaining how to do a good critical reflection, of which we highlight here the following two:
- "Critical reflection", at https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/critical-reflection
- "What is a Critical Reflection? Introducing the “What, So What, Now What” Model", at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyjF9Ngd8Y&t=2s

It is expected to have this assignment submitted by February 18, 23:59 (GMT), here in moodle.
